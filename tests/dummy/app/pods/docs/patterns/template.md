# Patterns

A summary of the patterns we encourage addon authors to follow when documenting their work.

## Documenting your addon with its dummy app

One of the more surprising results to come out of the addon community is the practicality of using an addon's dummy application as a full-fledged document site.

Every addon comes with a fully bootstrapped Ember application that can be found in `/tests/dummy` and runs during `ember s`. This dummy app is primarily intended to be used for acceptance tests. But it turns out that configuring it as a production application to be used as your docs site has many advantages:

- **You can show off your addon in the context of a real Ember app.** The dummy app provides you with a perfect sandbox for doing this.
- **You can write your docs using familiar technology.** You're an Ember developer, and so are your users. Using the dummy app means your doc site is built with tech you and your users know, making it easier for you and the community to maintain and improve your docs. Compare this to something like Jekyll, which requires your users to have Ruby installed and to have a basic understanding of Gemfiles.
- **It encourages you to write acceptance tests, and when you do, ensures your docs are never outdated.** Whenever you write acceptance tests for new behavior, you need to add that behavior to your dummy app. But now that your dummy app is your docs site, you won't just add throwaway or confusing examples, since you'll have an organized place to document all your addon's functionality for your end users.

  Once you document the new behavior in the appropriate place on your doc site, you can now write an acceptance test against it, ensuring (1) that the behavior actually works, and (2) that your docs are accurate and up-to-date. Win-win!

## Authoring in Markdown

We include the [Ember CLI Markdown Templates](#) addon so that you can opt-in to authoring any page you'd like as a Markdown file — just create a `template.md` file wherever you would normally create a `template.hbs` file. [The file you're reading](#) is an example.

Whenever you author a template as a Markdown file, we wrap it in a div with the class `.docs-md`. You can view our [predefined styles here](#) — feel free to overwrite these in your own app if you'd like.

For more complex pages, you can use a standard `template.hbs` file (and any other standard Ember file), since the dummy app really is just a bread-and-butter Ember application.

In addition to authoring normal Markdown content, you can

<aside>
  Here's an example of an aside.
</aside>

- Use an `<aside>` element. This is good for calling out important info or long-standing bug fixes that were part of a release.

- Use Handlebars helpers. For example, you can use `link-to` to render a link to {{link-to 'the home page' 'index'}}, or you can even render a component.

## App structure

You are free to use either classic or pods layout. This app is built using pods, in case you'd like to use it as a reference.

## Design decisions

The entire layout of the current page comes from the {{link-to 'Docs Viewer' 'docs.components.docs-viewer'}} component. This is an opinionated setup intended to be used with a dedicated `docs` route.

It features the nav area you see on the left and a main area for the content in the middle, with both sections filling up the available height and independently scrollable. This is a nice pattern used by many other online documentation viewers that gives your users easy access to navigation while also letting them focus on individual pieces of content without getting overwhelmed.

The nav is designed to be flexible enough for simple and complex addons. You should feel free to structure it as you see fit (some addons will need one section for Components but some will want more, and so on).

The large main area is also useful for addons that need more space to illustrate a concept or show a demo. However, most pages in an addon's docs site should be optimized for reading.

Typography choices were made primarily for readability. Measure, a typographic term for the number of characters is a line of text, is also an important aspect of readability, so by default most of the layouts you see will be wrapped with an appropriate max-width. To reiterate one of our main goals for the project, we want addon authors to get these patterns for free so they can focus on actually documenting and testing their addons.
