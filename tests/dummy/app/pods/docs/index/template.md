# Introduction

Dear addon author,

Welcome to Ember CLI Addon Docs!

This project was created to help you document and showcase your addon using the accumulated knowledge of the addon community. After surveying several popular project sites, we found that they had much in common, though addon authors are continually solving these same problems for themselves.

The app you are currently viewing is itself an example of an addon documented using Ember CLI Addon Docs. (It is a fortunate dog-fooding position that we find ourselves in). It is an Ember application that employs our thinking on best practices for layout, typography, and design, as well as several features from Addon Docs including

- Support for authoring pages in Markdown ([this very page](#) being an example)
- Interactive component examples
- Autogenerated {{#link-to 'docs.api'}}API docs{{/link-to}} from source-code comments

and more.

The goal of this project is to make these features and patterns easily available to you in a way that doesn't stifle your creativity. We understand your addon may require unique pages to demo or test its functionality, and you already may have an existing site up and running. So we've taken care to break up our primitives in a way that lets you pick and choose them as you see fit.

As with all open-source, our discovery of best practices is never finished. If you'd like to make a suggestion on any topic covered by this addon, [we'd love to hear from you](#).

## Installation

## Usage

The on-boarding story serves two major audiences: existing addons and new addons.

### Existing addons

### New addons

## Patterns

The goal of this addon is to inform you on best practices, while also providing easy tools to use to get you going.

### Documenting your addon with its dummy app

### Deploying your dummy app

### Design decisions

Discuss layout and typography.

Measure, a typographic term for the number of characters is a line of text, is an important part of readability.

### Writing guides

### Writing your API reference

## How to document your addon

In the beginning it's hard to know how you'd like to layout your documentation. We've designed this tool to be flexible.

The nav on the left is autogenerated from <code>h2</code> and <code>h3</code> headings found in your docs.

## Sharing code between addons

Be sure to document how to share code from your addon to others. Namespace your CSS, models, components and other exports. This library is a good example of how to do that.
