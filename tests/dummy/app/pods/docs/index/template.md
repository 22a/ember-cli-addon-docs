# Introduction

Dear addon author,

Welcome to Ember CLI Addon Docs!

This project was created to help you document and showcase your addon using the accumulated knowledge of the addon community. After surveying several popular project sites, we found that they had much in common, though addon authors have had no easy way to these techniques.

The app you are currently viewing is itself an example of an addon documented using Ember CLI Addon Docs â€” it is a fortunate dog-fooding position that we find ourselves in. This Ember application employs our thinking on best practices for layout, typography and design, as well as several features like

- Support for authoring pages in Markdown ([this very page](#) being an example)
- Interactive component demos
- Autogenerated {{#link-to 'docs.api'}}API docs{{/link-to}} from source code comments

and more.

The goal of this project is to make these features and patterns easily available to you in a way that doesn't stifle your creativity. We understand your addon may require unique pages to demo or test its functionality, and you may already have an existing site up and running. So we've taken care to break up our primitives so that you can pick and choose them as you see fit.

As with all open-source, our discovery of best practices is never finished. If you'd like to make a suggestion on any topic covered by this addon, [we'd love to hear from you](#).
