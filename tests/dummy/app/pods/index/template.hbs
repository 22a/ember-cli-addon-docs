    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <aside>Looking for the quickstart? {{link-to 'Click here' 'docs.quickstart'}}.</aside>
    <p>Documenting software libraries has gotten easier. We have nicely-formatted README.md files, the ability to host custom sites for free on GitHub Pages, and even dedicated tools like <a href="#">GitBook</a> and <a href="#">ReadTheDocs</a>. But even though these tools have come a long way, modern developers have high expectations, and library authors can quickly find themselves juggling more tasks than they can manage.</p>
    <p>Ember addons occupy a unique space here. Besides everything that's expected of any modern JavaScript library, there's even more that goes into authoring a library that plays nicely with an ecosystem as mature as Ember's. And too often addon authors with limited time must choose between being a better community citizen, or focusing on the core problem their library was created to solve in the first place.</p>
    <p>These days, a well-maintained Ember addon should</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide interactive demos of their components</strong> in the context of an Ember app</li>
      <li><strong>Show current <em>and versioned</em> guides,</strong> ideally whose content is verified by automated tests</li>
      <li><strong>Show current <em>and versioned</em> API documentation</strong> derived from structured comments in source code</li>
      <li><strong>Have excellent test coverage</strong> across a matrix of Ember and Ember CLI versions</li>
      <li><strong>Make it easy for contributors to correct documentation errors</strong> in addition to submitting code fixes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Looking at the available tools for authoring docs, none proved satisfactory for all these needs. This is why addons deserve their own solution.</p>
    <p>Finish...</p>
